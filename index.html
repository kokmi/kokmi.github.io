    neighborhood. This piece of northern Manhattan, flanked by the East and Harlem rivers, 
    started to house German Jews that arrived in New York during the first decades of the
    twentieth century. Now, Washington Heights is a place where people who have Latino origins congregate. When 
    we explore the <a href="http://opportunityatlas.org">opportunity map</a>, we found it interesting that economic outcomes vary in genders 
    of the Hispanic group as the two pictures depict as below. </p></div>

<h2 style="color:blue">Conclusions</h2>
 <div align="justify">
  <p style="margin-left:450px;margin-right:450px">To be honest, Hispanic males in the southern Washington Heights perform more poorly than females. 
    However, this "poorer performance depends how to evaluate their achivements. Specifically, when considering in the 
    whole context, males earn more than females in common. Nevertheless, the individual income of men in the Heights stays in 
    a lower level according to the nation average. Therefore, Hispanic males seem to behave worse in the Heights eventhough they
    earn more. This "poor behavior" can also be reflected in the employment rate of different genders, while Hispanic women who grew
    up here will have higher employment rate in their adults. Despite similar possibilities of still staying in the neighborhood, 
    Hispanic men are willing to stay in the same tract rather than go out to find work opportunities. Therefore, <mark>the work opportunities
    are much more limited and competitive for Hispanic males</mark> who grew up here.
   <br></br>
   Concentrating on opportunities for <mark> people from different family origins </mark>, individuals
   from high-income families earn more in their adults. Probably, they get more access to excellent education
   quality and are more skillful in workforce.</p>
